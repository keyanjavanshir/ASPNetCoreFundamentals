  - Use built-in middleware such as HTTP logging and authentication.  
  - Build custom middleware to handle custom request/response logic.

- **Dependency Injection (DI)**  
  - Learn how DI is a core part of ASP.NET Core.  
  - Use the built-in service container to manage and inject dependencies.  
  - Register and resolve services in the app.

- **Publishing and Deployment**
